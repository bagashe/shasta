<h2>Guidelines for contributing</h2>

<p>
Contributions of code, ideas, computational experiments,
or documentation are welcome. 
To contribute, please use the standard GitHub Pull Request process.
To facilitate integration of your code,
you can use a new branch for each Pull Request.
You can choose any name you like for the branch you create for this purpose,
as long as it does not conflict with the name of an existing branch.

<p>
If you contribute C++ code, please:
<ul>
<li>Add at least a minimal amount
of comments to explain or clarify what the code does. 
<li>Use blank lines generously to separate code blocks.
<li>Set your editor to convert tabs to 4 spaces.
<li>To minimize name pollution of the global namespace,
all code should be in the <code>ChanZuckerberg::shasta</code> namespace.
Do not use <code>using</code> directives at global scope.
<li>If you need to add a large amount of code to an existing
file, consider creating a new file instead.
<li>Keep in mind that the code is currently compiled
using the C++14 standard. Use features in that standard
liberally. However, you cannot use C++ features
that were introduced in the C++17 standard
or that are slated for the C++20 standard.
<li>For functionality not provided
by the standard libraries, you can also use the Boost libraries.
<li>If possible, avoid adding dependencies on other packages.
</ul>

<p>
To contribute ideas, computational experiments,
comments, or criticism, please use the GitHub 
 
<a href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues">Issues</a>
section of the GitHub repository.

<p>
If you contribute documentation, please:
<ul>
<li>Put it in the <code>docs</code>
directory, so it becomes automatically visible in GitHub Pages.
<li>Feel free to create new <code>.html</code> files, if appropriate.
<li>Attempt to harmonize your new materials with the existing
documentation, if possible.
</ul>
