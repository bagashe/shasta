<h1>Reporting problems or asking questions</h1>

<p>
If you bump into problems using the Shasta assembler,
or if you have questions or suggestions, 
feel free to 
<a href='https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues'>
submit an issue</a> on GitHub.

An effort will be made to respond to issues rapidly.
However there is currently only one person doing this,
and therefore there can occasionally be periods where
issues are not processed for one/two weeks.

<p>
Please use one issue per topic when possible:
<ul>
<li>If a new problem occurs, create a new issue rather than appending to an old one.
Ok to append to an existing issue for discussion of the same problem for 
which the issue was originally filed.
<li>If two different problems arise
on the same run, please file two separate issues. 
</ul>
